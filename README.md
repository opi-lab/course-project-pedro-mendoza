# FINAL PROJECT OF ARTIFICIAL VISION

PEDRO NEL MENDOZA VANEGAS

This final project mainly is about an appropiate and efficient MATLAB program for face recognition using eigenfaces approach 
and PCA and perform tests with a dataset of face images of actors of action movies. The face recognition task is performed by 
comparison of given test image with training images and obtain an image recognized. 
In the experiment, the user enter the access routes to the stored dataset and the test image with which he desires to validate 
the correct operation of the training set. Finally some results are showed (one for each actor: Brad Pitt, Arnold Schwarzenneger, 
Dwayne Johnson, Will Smith and Sylvester Stallone). 

The results demonstrate that the program recognizes some test face correctly, but performing modifications between the training 
folder and the test folder, a coincidence doesnâ€™t always happen. This is because the database was of very few image and then, 
the algorithm is not optimal.

It tried to implement the program in python but there were problems with logic and syntax when translating the MATLAB program into python.
Additionally, it was necessary that all the images to be compared were aligned to make the algorithm more robust; for this, a series of
geometric transformations on the images of the faces had to be taken into account.
